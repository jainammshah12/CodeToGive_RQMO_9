## Project Description ##
A web-based game where the user discovers the challenges of establishing a diagnosis within the rare disease context.

## User Flow ##
- Prompt for symptoms and description
- Give the treatment plan if it is similar to another disease
- If no one has ever heard of it and never been diagnosed, then collect further information regarding genetics, environment and tests (blood, urine, etc.).
- Ask for further resources - access to pharmacy, access to medical assistance like hospitals, nurses, doctors, etc. and provide what can be done.

## Current Progress ##
- Built using React.js and Node.js.
- Simplified UI and Game Design
